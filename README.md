# Hydro / MSR Mini-Conference
On November 17, 2020, a group of researchers from Berkeley and MSR got together to hold a half-day mini-conference, prompted by connections between the Berkeley Anna and MSR FASTER projects, and then the Berkeley Cloudburst and MSR AMBROSIA projects.

The agenda for the day was as follows. (Links to talks to be added)
