# Hydro / MSR Mini-Conference 2020
On November 17, 2020, a group of researchers from Berkeley and MSR got together to hold a half-day mini-conference, prompted by connections between the Berkeley [Anna](https://github.com/hydro-project/anna) and MSR [FASTER](https://github.com/microsoft/FASTER) storage projects, and then the Berkeley [Cloudburst](https://github.com/hydro-project/cloudburst) and MSR [AMBROSIA](https://github.com/microsoft/AMBROSIA) compute projects.

The agenda for the day was as follows. 
- Berkeley [DSF](http://dsf.berkeley.edu)/[RISELab](http://rise.berkeley.edu).
